## About

Our project is called Music Fwends! A simple social media website that allows users to interact and communicate with a focal point on music. Users can post their music tastes and views publicly whilst other users can view, comment and react accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to collaborate with a team of developers, coming together whilst using multiple technologies in conjuction to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

<!-- ## Future Development -->

## Requirements

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.
